<b>Sissel</b> (シセル <i>Sissel</i>) is the protagonist of the game. He wakes
up to find that he is already dead and there is a woman being held at gunpoint
by a blue hitman. A ghost named Ray, who takes on the form of a desk lamp, guides
him to save the woman, Lynne. He soon realises that he has lost his memory and sets
out to find who he is and why he was killed. His powers include manipulating objects, 
travelling through telephone lines and replaying the last four minutes before death.<br>

In actuality, Sissel is a cat who belonged to the blond man he identified
as himself and was his only friend for ten years. He was in the bag that
Yomiel was carrying that night and was accidentally shot while Yomiel was
manipulating Lynne. Though he later erases that death, his past self ends
up getting killed by the Temsik fragment and he gets to keep his ghost tricks
as well as his body, which is frozen forever as a kitten.<br>

<img src="lynne.png"><br>
<b>Lynne</b> (リンネ <i>Lynne</i>) is a rookie detective who is working alone on
a case tonight. After becoming the target of hitmen and being saved by Sissel, she
teams up with him so they can help each other with their individual tasks. She lives
in an apartment with a little girl named Kamila and a dog named Missile.<br>

The case she is working on involves a detective by the name of Jowd who went to prison
five years before for murder, though she believes he is innocent. Ten years ago, she was
taken hostage and was saved by Detective Jowd, whom she has looked up to ever since. Lynne
is suspected of Sissel's murder and is even shown shooting him on a tape, but it turns out
Yomiel was manipulating Lynne into shooting his "shell".

<img src="ray.png"><br>
<b>Ray</b> (クネリ <i>Kuneri</i>) appears before Sissel as a desk lamp and teaches him about his

him to help out Lynne as she is the key to his memories. He also informs
him that he will disappear by daybreak.<br>
<b>Name meaning:</b> "Kuneru" is a Japanese word meaning to wriggle/flex/bend.<br>

<img src="oldmissile.png"><br>
In actuality, Ray is an older Missile from a timeline in which Lynne and Kamila
died. When that timeline's Sissel refused to help him, since he was only interested
in finding his memories, Missile chased after Yomiel. Yomiel had been there in the
apartment when Missile and Kamila were killed, inadvertently giving Missile ghost
tricks. Missile ended up in the submarine's control room with Yomiel's corpse and
went back ten years to the time of Yomiel's death. There, he waited until that fateful
night came round so that he could coerce Sissel into helping him.

<img src="kamila.png"><br>
<b>Kamila</b> (カノン <i>Kanon</i>) is a young girl who lives with Lynne and Missile. She
ends up in danger when a hitman comes to the apartment, but Sissel manages to save her.
She then leaves to go and deliver an important music box to Lynne.<br>

with compassion. It is also a pun on "cannon", which fits with Missile.<br>
<br>
<div class="spoiler">
    <input type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this);" value="Spoiler" />
    <div class="inner" style="display:none;">
Kamila is really the daughter of Detective Jowd. Five years ago, she was at home alone and
built a birthday surprise for her mother. Unfortunately, Yomiel manipulated it into killing 
her mother and her father confessed to the crime to protect Kamila. When taking the music box
to Lynne, she ends up getting kidnapped by the organization, because she was mistaken for the
daughter of the justice minister.

Missile manages to escape the apartment and catches up with Kamila in the park. When running after her,
he is hit by a moped and falls into a crater where he dies again. This time though, he receives ghost
tricks and uses them to save Kamila when she is crushed by Mino.  Missile goes on to aid Sissel in 
averting other deaths. His powers include swapping objects and replaying the four minutes before a death.

<img src="cabanela.png"><br>

Unit. He is particularly fond of Lynne. It is rumoured that he only cares about his spotless record.<br>
<b>Name Meaning:</b> His name is derived from "shikabane", the Japanese word for corpse.<br>
<div class="spoiler">
    <input type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this);" value="Spoiler" />
    <div class="inner" style="display:none;">
Inspector Cabanela used to be friends with Detective Jowd until he was arrested for murder. After Jowd was
arrested, Cabanela focused only on reaching the top of the ladder. He apprehends Jowd during his prison escape, 
making it appear he cares more about his spotless record than his old friend. It turns out that the reason he
became head of the Special Investigation Unit was to oversee and control all aspects of the manipulator case
in an effort to save Jowd, whom he truly believed to be innocent. He prevented his escape so that he wouldn't
commit a crime. Ten years ago, Cabanela was involved in the incident when he was interrogating Yomiel and pushed
him too far. He left his gun in the room by mistake, giving Yomiel the means to escape.<br>

<div class="spoiler">
    <input type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this);" value="Spoiler" />
    <div class="inner" style="display:none;">
He used to be a top detective until he turned himself in for murder. His daughter's birthday surprise contraption
had gone horribly wrong, killing her mother, and he handed himself in for her sake. He initially wants to be executed
but after learning about the powers of the dead and realising someone else was responsible for the death of his wife,
he changes his mind and goes after the manipulator. Ten years ago, he was involved in the hostage situation and was
about to shoot Yomiel before the meteorite struck him. He felt guilty about it ever since.

    <div class="inner" style="display:none;">
He used to be a medical examiner working for the police and was assigned to perform the autopsy on Yomiel's body. He 
couldn't perform the autopsy due to the body healing itself and then it disappeared. He detected the strange radiation
coming from it and found the same radiation being emitted from the Temsik meteorite. He quit his job and went on to
research Temsik. After Jowd was arrested, he built a replica of the contraption Kamila had built to prove his innocence. 
A year prior to the events of the game, Cabanela turned up at his office and they teamed up to discover the true secrets 
behind the meteoriteand the manipulator's powers.

    <input type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this);" value="Spoiler" />
    <div class="inner" style="display:none;">
He signed the order for Jowd to be executed despite being against the death penalty. It turned out Yomiel had manipulated
him into doing it. The organization even went so far as to kidnap his daughter to make sure the execution went ahead (although
they grabbed the wrong girl) His wife moved out after learning about what happened. After Sissel helps his daughter to call
him and Lynne brings him the gun that killed Jowd's wife, the Justice Minister calls the execution order off.

<img src="emma.png"><br>
<b>Emma</b> (エンマ <i>Emma</i>) is the wife of the Justice Minister, who moved out with her daughter and refuses to answer her husband's
calls. She works frantically on her novel through the night, trying to complete it before the deadline. Barking dogs are a great nuisance 
to her.<br>

<div class="spoiler">
    <input type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this);" value="Spoiler" />

<b>The Manipulator</b><br>
This mysterious person is the cause of many strange things happening in this town tonight.<br>
<div class="spoiler">
    <input type="button" onclick="showSpoiler(this);" value="Spoiler" />
    <div class="inner" style="display:none;">
<img src="yomiel.png"><br>
<b>Yomiel</b> (ヨミエル <i>Yomiel</i>) is the true owner of the body Sissel mistakes as his. His ghost
powers include manipulating objects and living things/corpses, and travelling through phone lines.<br>
<b>Name Meaning:</b> Yomiel comes from the Japanese word "yomigaeru", meaning to revive.<br>
<br>
Ten years ago, Yomiel was a top systems programmer who was invited to a project involving national
secrets. He ended up getting accused of being a spy and got taken in for interrogation. Cabanela
bulled him into losing all hope and left his gun in the room, giving Yomiel the chance to escape. Jowd chased
Yomiel down to the park, forcing him to take Lynne hostage. At that moment, the Temsik meteorite crashed down and
a stray fragment pieced Yomiel's back. Yomiel appeared to be dead, but his body was actually a "shell" constantly
cycling between the moments of life and death. He was able to control it at will after a while, but it was too late
and he was already officially dead.<br>
<br>
At the time of his death, he attached himself to a stray kitten in the park that approached him and lived with him for
a while. Yomiel eventually got his memories and his body back then went to see his fiancée. Sadly, she had already killed
herself to join him. He named the kitten Sissel in her memory. Due to everyone believing he was dead, Sissel was his only
friend during those ten years and he was unbearably lonely. Five years after his death, he executed a plan to make Jowd
feel the pain that he felt, by killing his wife.<br>
<br>
That wasn't enough for Yomiel and he went on to plot revenge against those he blamed for stealing his life. He enlisted the
help of an organization and made a deal with them. They would get the source of his powers in exchange for help with his
revenge plot and a "new life" for him. He wanted Cabanela and Jowd dead, and Lynne framed for murder.<br>
<br>
The organization ended up betraying Yomiel and stealing his Temsik fragment. He gave up on revenge after Lynne understood
the pain he had been in and shed tears for him.
