In actuality, Sissel is a cat who belonged to the man he identified
as himself, and his only friend for ten years. He was in the bag that
Yomiel was carrying that night and was accidentally shot while Yomiel was
manipulating Lynne. Though he later erases Yomiel's death, his past self ends
up getting killed by the Temsik fragment and he gets to keep his ghost tricks
as well as his body, which is frozen forever as a kitten.<br>

The case she is working on involves a detective imprisoned for murder who she believes he is innocent. 
Ten years ago, she was taken hostage and was saved by Detective Jowd, whom she has looked up to ever since.

<img src="ray.png"><br>
<b>Ray</b> (クネリ <i>Kuneri</i>) appears before Sissel as a desk lamp and teaches him about his

In actuality, Ray is an older Missile from a timeline in which Lynne and Kamila
died. When that timeline's Sissel refused to help him, being only interested in 
recovering his lost memory, Missile chased after Yomiel. Yomiel had been there in the
apartment when Missile and Kamila were killed, inadvertently giving Missile ghost
tricks. Missile ended up in the submarine's control room with Yomiel's corpse and
went back ten years to the time of Yomiel's death. There, he waited until that fateful
night came round so that he could coerce Sissel into helping him.

Kamila is really the daughter of Detective Jowd. Five years ago, she was at home alone and
built a birthday surprise for her mother. Unfortunately, Yomiel manipulated it into killing 
her mother and her father confessed to the crime to protect Kamila. When taking the music box

daughter of the justice minister.

Missile manages to escape the apartment and catches up with Kamila in the park. When running after her,
he is hit by a moped and falls into a crater where he dies again. This time though, he receives ghost
tricks and uses them to save Kamila when she is crushed by Mino.  Missile goes on to aid Sissel in

Inspector Cabanela used to be friends with Detective Jowd until he was arrested for murder. After Jowd was
arrested, Cabanela focused only on reaching the top of the ladder. He apprehends Jowd during his prison escape, 
making it appear he cares more about his spotless record than his old friend. It turns out that the reason he
became head of the Special Investigation Unit was to oversee and control all aspects of the manipulator case
in an effort to save Jowd, whom he truly believed to be innocent. He prevented his escape so that he wouldn't
commit a crime. Ten years ago, Cabanela was involved in the incident when he was interrogating Yomiel and pushed
him too far. He left his gun in the room by mistake, giving Yomiel the means to escape.<br>

ever since.

powers include manipulating objects and living things/corpses, and travelling through phone lines.<br>
<b>Name Meaning:</b> Yomiel comes from the Japanese word "yomigaeru", meaning to revive.<br>
<br>
Ten years ago, Yomiel was a top systems programmer. He was invited onto a project involving national secrets
and ended up being suspected of being a spy. Cabanela interrogated him harshly, causing him to lose hope then 
accidentally left his gun, giving Yomiel the means to escape. Jowd chased him down, driving him to take Lynne
hostage and end up being struck down by a fragment of a falling meteorite. Yomiel received ghost tricks and his
body became a shell trapped between life and death. 
<br>
<br>
After dying, Yomiel lived in the body of a stray kitten before recovering his memories. He retrieved his body and hurried 
to see his fiancee, only to find she had ended her life to join him. Yomiel named the kitten Sissel after her. A lonely
existence followed, driving Yomiel to kill Jowd's wife and make Jowd feel the same pain. Years later, Yomiel sought out
revenge against those he blamed for his death, with the assistance of an organization. He made a deal with them, the source
of his powers and his co-operation in erasing those who knew of Temsik in exchange for a new life. <br>
<br>
The organization ended up betraying Yomiel and stealing the Temsik fragment. He abandons his plans for revenge and travels
into the past with Sissel, Missile and Jowd. Together, they create a new ten years where he lives.
