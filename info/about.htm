About the site</div>
<br />
Ghost Trick has a rather small fandom and while you can find some
places here and there to discuss it or show off your creativity or
whatnot, there actually wasn't a dedicated fansite for it yet. I felt
it needed a site that could accumulate information and media relating
to it and put it all together that could serve as a valuable resource
and so I took on the duty of making a Ghost Trick site. Originally, I
registered the domain "ghosttrick.net" and just called the site "Ghost
Trick", but then I realised it was a bit lazy and unoriginal. I wanted
it to have a proper name, so I decided to call it "Temsik Park", after
a very important location in the game, and registered a new domain for
the site. So now, here we are. The first site was launched in late July
2011 and then the second site came in August 2011. Yes, I did change my
mind about it very quickly, didn't I? After a few years of absence from the 
	fandom, the site was reuploaded to Github. <br />

<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: left;">I'm Caz, a girl who likes to game, mostly JRPGs 
	and visual novel style games though I do partake in the odd walking 
	simulator or adventure game too. As a fan of the Ace Attorney games, it only 
	seemed natural that I would be into another game from Shu Takumi himself. I 
	ended up loving the game enough to go and make an entire site for it. I've 
	written a ton of fanfiction for it too, so if you're into reading 
	fanfiction, you can check it out on Archive of our Own, under the penname 
	kyarorain.
