<div style="text-align: center;">The promotion manager for<br>
"Ghost Trick" gave me one doozy<br>
of an order.<br>
<br>
How was I supposed to show how<br>
awesome the powers of the dead<br>
are in a super short amount of time?<br>
<br>
I asked a friend for some advice.<br>
<br>
"How about bringing a smile <br>
to a little girl's face?!"<br>
<br>
It wasn't a bad idea...<br>
<br>
With that in mind, I arrived at the<br>
special Apartment stage that was<br>
designed just for the "Trial Version"...<br>
<br>
...in my usual ghostly manner,<br>
over the telephone lines.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">Missile: Hey, Sissel!<br>
<br>
Sissel: ........<br>
<br>
Missile: I'm so glad you could make it!<br>
<br>
Sissel: ........ Ah, yes... Just the <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">friend</span> I was talking about.<br>
<br>
Missile: Yup, that's me! I'm everyone's favorite extraordinary little
doggie "Missile"! Now come on! We've got a poor little girl to cheer up!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Little girl? You mean the one sitting on the sofa?<br>
<br>
Missile: Yeah, that's my owner, Miss Kamila!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Maybe I should just observe my
surroundings for now and get my bearings.)</span><br>
<br>
Kamila: *sigh* I can't believe Christmas Eve is almost over. It's 11:56
right now, which means there are only four minutes left. Lynne even
promised she'd give me a present... I guess work is keeping her busy.
Oh, I know! I'll listen to some music!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(A <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">clock chime</span>...)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: I guess that's it, huh? That's all for "<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Christmas Eve</span>."<br>
<br>
Sissel: Yeah, and the little lady spent it all alone.<br>
<br>
Missile: Actually... I sorta knew this would happen.<br>
<br>
Sissel: ...?<br>
<br>
Missile: I knew Miss Lynne probably wouldn't be able to come home until
late... and that there's a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">present</span>
hidden inside this very room, waiting to be delivered.<br>
<br>
Sissel: A <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">hidden</span> present,
eh?<br>
<br>
Missile: Yup! If we could find it and give it to Miss Kamila... ...I
bet it'd bring a big smile to her face! Ooh! We could do it with your "<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">powers of the dead</span>"!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(My "powers of the dead," eh? I
suppose he means my "<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ghost tricks</span>"...)</span>
That's all well and good, Missile, but... ...I don't know where this
"present" is.<br>
<br>
Missile: Oh, that's all right! Just take a look around. I won't get in
your way!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Sounds like he's not going to be
of any help...)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: Let's see... The present is some kind of <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">wooden box</span>, I think. Anyway,
just give it a try! But maybe you should start from the very beginning?<br>
<br>
Sissel: The "beginning"...?<br>
<br>
Missile: Give the [hourglass icon] a touch and you'll see. You can
travel back in time to <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">four
minutes before</span> the end of Christmas Eve!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Are you serious? Look, it's not like she can't get the present
tomorrow, you know...<br>
<br>
Missile: Come on! Time's a wasting! Hurry up and touch the [hourglass
icon] button!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(And travel to <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">four minutes before</span> the end of
Christmas Eve...? Well, what have I got to lose?)</span><br>
<br>
[Rewind]<br>
<br>
Sissel: Now to return to "four minutes before" and start playing this
"Trial Version" for real.<br>
<br>
[Rewind Time]<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">And so I returned to the world of<br>
"four minutes before" in an attempt<br>
to defeat this "Trial Version"...<br>
<br>
And to bring a smile to the<br>
little lady's face -- my own<br>
present to her.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">Kamila: *sigh* I can't believe Christmas
Eve is almost over. It's 11:56 right now, which means there are only
four minutes left. Lynne even promised she'd give me a present...<br>
<br>
Missile: Now! Let the game begin!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Sure, let's go.<br>
<br>
Missile: Um, about your "powers," basically, you can possess and
manipulate things. And since you're a ghost, you can possess with the
Ghost button!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(The Ghost button? Guess I should
give it a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">touch</span> and see.)</span><br>
<br>
[Ghost]<br>
<br>
Sissel: Whoa!<br>
<br>
Missile: This is the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Ghost World</span>.
Right
now, you're possessing a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">telephone</span>.
But
you should try possessing other things! Give the <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">top screen</span> a glance whenever you
want to see how to do something!<br>
<br>
[Jump to drawer/umbrella]<br>
<br>
Missile: Ooh, looks like you managed to <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">possess</span> something else! Now
let's see what you can do with it!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Manipulate</span> it, you
mean?<br>
<br>
Missile: Yup, and to do that, you first have to return to the <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">land of the living</span>. This time,
the Back button is <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">your ticket out</span>
of the Ghost World.<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Better give that Back button a <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">touch</span>, I guess.)</span><br>
<br>
[Back]<br>
<br>
Missile: Okay! Next comes the Trick button! That's how you <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">manipulate</span> the thing you're
possessing!<br>
<br>
[Trick]<br>
<br>
Sissel: So that was me just now, eh? I manipulated that with my
powers...<br>
<br>
Missile: That makes you the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Master
of
the Dead</span>!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Which is something I'd rather NOT be the master of, thank you
very much.<br>
<br>
Missile: Anyway! We've gotta get Miss Kamila her present before
midnight!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Speaking of present, where exactly is it?<br>
<br>
Missile: Umm, well, all I know is that it's a wooden box... ... Oh,
hey! I've got an idea! Why don't we take a look around this room and
see if we can't find it?<br>
<br>
Sissel: "Look around"...? We can do that?!<br>
<br>
Missile: Sure, it's easy! All you have to do is <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">slide</span> the screen, in your case.<br>
<br>
Sissel: Slide the screen, eh?<br>
<br>
Missile: Or just use [d-pad] -- it does the same thing!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Guess I should try looking for
this "<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">wooden box</span>" of a
present...)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: Now! The game is afoot!<br>
<br>
[If you read Kamila's thought bubble during the tutorial]<br>
<br>
Kamila: Lynne even promised she'd give me a present... I guess work is
keeping her busy. Oh, I know! I'll listen to some music!<br>
<br>
Missile: Sissel! It's nice of you to listen to her, but time's still
passing us by! It's important to listen to others, but if we can't make
any progress, then... <br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Possess and manipulate, eh? "<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Ghost</span>," and then "<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Trick</span>"...)</span> If I want to
use my "powers of the dead," I'm going to have to use those buttons. <span
 style="color: blue;">(As they say, everything starts with a <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">touch</span>!)</span><br>
<br>
[Manipulate - phone]<br>
<br>
Sissel: I can't use the phone lines in this "Trial Version." Maybe I
should touch Ghost and try possessing something else.<br
 style="color: blue;">
<br>
[Dialog bubble]<br>
<br>
Missile: Now! Let's give Miss Kamila her present!<br>
<br>
Sissel: You said it's a <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">wooden box</span>
of some sort, right? But I have to get it before I can get it to her.<br>
<br>
Missile: You know what I do when I'm in a jam? I roll around and
around. Then again, I do that even when I'm not, which is pretty much
most of the day!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(The only things rolling here are
my eyes... Besides, I'd rather <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">slide</span>
the screen to take a look around. Better get going.)</span><span
 class="style1"><br>
<br>
</span>[Manipulate - umbrella] (to drop headphones in tank)<br>
<br>
Kamila: How did I manage to do that? Lynne just bought those
headphones, too... How about if we tell her you did it, Missile?<br>
<br>
[Dialog bubble]<br>
<br>
Sissel: There, now the little lady won't be able to listen to her music.<br>
<br>
Missile: That's a really terrible thing you just did, Sissel. <br>
<br>
Sissel: How am I supposed to answer when you're glaring at me like
that? <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(It looks like I can <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">change the outcome</span> of events
with some good timing. I'd better keep that fact nugget in mind...)</span><br>
<br>
[Manipulate - door] (to hit Missile, while Kamila is getting headphones)<br>
<br>
Missile: Wh-what do you think you're doing?!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Oh, uh... sorry, Missile. It's just that when I see something
small and puntable... <br>
<br>
Missile: Do I look like a football to you?!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(These powers are more fun than I
thought...)</span><br>
<br>
[Manipulate - door] (to hit rat after dropping a donut)<br>
<br>
Missile: Wow! You sent that thing flying!<br>
<br>
Sissel: I like to keep things tidy. Heh heh.<br>
<br>
Missile: Well, you'll never catch me near that door! Nope, no way!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Just great... Now that he's said
that, it makes me want to "tidy" him up too.)</span><br
 style="color: blue;">
<br>
[Manipulate - door] (When Missile is next to it after Kamila comes to
quieten him down)<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Ha ha! I did it!)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: You know, you're not making a friend out of me by gloating in
my face...<br>
<br>
Sissel: Ah, sorry, Missile. For some reason, I just really, really
wanted to send you flying.<br>
<br>
Missile: That's all right. It's better that you did it on purpose than
by accident. Just don't do it again, okay?!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(What was that all
about? He sure let me off the hook lightly...)</span><br>
<br>
[Manipulate - donuts. Let Missile bark at the rat.]<br>
<br>
Kamila: Missile! You know you're not supposed to bark like that! <br>
<br>
Missile: Whenever I heroically bark like that... Miss Kamila always
comes to praise me and my bravery!<br>
<br>
Sissel: ......... That wasn't exactly "praise" she was giving you,
Missile. <br>
<br>
Missile: Huh, really? But I thought it was... I guess everyone is
entitled to their own opinions.<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(But no one is entitled to their
own facts...)</span><br>
<br>
[Manipulate - donuts.] (after one has fallen)<br>
<br>
Sissel: Huh? <span style="color: blue;">(I can't make another donut
fall.)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: Hmm, what do we do now? Without that donut, the squeaky guy
won't come, and I won't bark!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Yeah, and the barking part is your favorite, right? <span
 style="color: blue;">(Hmm... it looks like only one donut will fall.)</span><br>
<br>
[Manipulate - star ornament]<br>
<br>
Missile: Whoo! I just love barking!<br>
<br>
Sissel: And causing the little lady trouble, it seems. <br>
<br>
Missile: Say what you will, but... ...barking runs through my veins!
It's like music to my ears! It's something we dogs take a lot of pride
in, you know.<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(You'd do well to throw that pride
away, in this case... But before you do, I wonder if I can use that
"noise" to my advantage somehow?)</span><br>
<br>
[Manipulate - latch]<br>
<br>
Sissel: That thing I just made drop... That was the "<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">wooden box</span>," wasn't it?<br>
<br>
Missile: Yeah, I think so!<br>
<br>
Sissel: Which means that's the "<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">present</span>,"
I guess.<br>
<br>
Missile: Ooh! Great job! You really did it, Sissel!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span style="color: blue;">(Now all we have to do... ... is <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">give</span> it to the little lady
somehow...)</span><br>
<br>
(Clock chimes)<br>
<br>
Missile: Oh, no! That's the clock! Once it chimes twelve times...<br>
<br>
Sissel: ... Our <span class="style2">time's up</span>, eh? <span
 class="style1">(Can I still make it, or am I already too late?)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: Don't give up yet! You never know, so keep on trying!<br>
<br>
(Time runs out.)<br>
<br>
Missile: Sorry, Sissel, but it looks like we're out of time.<br>
<br>
Sissel: That final stroke of midnight was our <span class="style2">time
limit</span>, eh?<br>
<br>
Missile: Let's try possessing and manipulating other things and see how
they work! <br>
<br>
Sissel: <span class="style1">(Sounds like a plan. I should give it
another shot from the beginning.)<br>
</span><br>
(Time runs out after restart.)<br>
<br>
Sissel: Time can be such a harsh mistress, as can her servant, the <span
 class="style2">time limit</span>.<br>
<br>
Missile: Well, if you still can't find the present, I suggest taking a
look around!<br>
<br>
Sissel: You mean the whole "<span class="style2">slide</span> the
screen" thing? <span class="style1">(Or that [d-pad] thing...)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: Yeah! And I'm sure you can create a path for yourself by
manipulating things!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span class="style1">(This is no time to be picky -- I've got
to give possessing everything I can a try!)<br>
</span><br>
[Rewind]<br>
<br>
Sissel: Guess I'd better rewind the clock again and see if I can pick
up any others clues.<br>
<br>
[Return to Title]<br>
<br>
Sissel: This isn't the end of the "Trial Version," but maybe I just
need a break?<br>
<br>
(Alternate dialog if you let Kamila put her headphones on)<br>
<br>
[Manipulate - donuts.]<br>
<br>
Sissel: Bark too loudly much?<br>
<br>
Missile: I can't help it! It's the squeaky guy's fault! If I don't make
a stand, he'll walk all over me!<br>
<br>
Sissel: That's besides the point... But I guess no matter how much of a
racket you make, she won't hear you. <span class="style1">(All because
of those headphones.)<br>
<br>
</span>Missile: Miss Kamila's off in her own world, huh?<br>
<br>
Sissel: Not unlike a certain furball I know...<br>
<br>
[Manipulate - star ornament]<br>
<br>
Sissel: I'm speechless... I can't believe the little lady can't hear
any of this noise.<br>
<br>
Missile: Whenever she puts those <span class="style2">red things</span>
on, that's it! I can call her name until my throat is sore, but she
never hears me!<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span class="style1">(That bad, huh...?)</span><br>
<br>
Missile: To be perfectly honest... <strong>I hate those <span
 class="style2"> red things</span>!<br>
<br>
</strong>Sissel: In that case, I guess I should shut this ornament
off...<br>
<br>
[Time runs out after you drop the present and play the ornament]<br>
<br>
Sissel: Darn, I thought I had it...<br>
<br>
Missile: But you couldn't get Miss Kamila to even look your way, could
you?<br>
<br>
Sissel: Well, what do you expect with those <span class="style2">headphones</span>
sitting on her head?<br>
<br>
Missile: Yeah, once she puts them on, Miss Kamila turns "<span
 class="style2">invincible</span>" in a sense.<br>
<br>
Sissel: <span class="style1">(I guess, first and foremost, I have to
do something about those headphones.)<br>
<br>
</span>Missile: Remember, if you ever find yourself thinking, "I messed
up!" I recommend giving [Rewind] a touch!<br>
<br>
(End alternate dialog)<br>
<br>
[Manipulate - ornament] (after dropping present)<br>
<br>
Kamila: What's this? It looks like a <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">music box</span>. Oh, I just knew Lynne
got a present for me! <br>
<br>
Sissel: Looks like we made it this time around. <br>
<br>
Missile: Yeah, we brought a smile to Miss Kamila's face. <br>
<br>
Sissel: While bringing one to yours, too, it seems, Missile.<br>
<br>
Missile: It's all thanks to you, Sissel! <br>
<br>
Sissel: Thanks, but now I've got to go. <br>
<br>
Missile: You do?! But you just got here! Um, Sissel...? Do you think...
we'll ever see each other again? <br>
<br>
Sissel: Sure, I don't see why not. Especially if you happen to die
again.<br>
<br>
Missile: Really? Well, just in case we don't, I'll... I'll... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I'll never forget you!</span><br>
