Shu Takumi first thought of making Ghost Trick in 2004, with the title of "Ghost Spy", while
he was working on Apollo Justice. The project ended up being put on hold while Ace Attorney was
ported to the DS.<br />

There are a few images on the Japanese official site, which can be
found in one of the columns. I've reposted
them here with some additional comments.<br />

Here we have the junkyard. It hasn't changed very much in production. As we can see, many of 
the items that are in the junkyard can be found in the picture. The placement of
these objects looks rather random here. Most likely it was only a
concept at this stage and they hadn't actually planned the level out.<br />

Concept artwork showing the junkyard as seen in the above picture.
Another piece of concept art can be seen behind it, which depicts a
room with a person, a cat (or maybe it's a dog. I'm not really sure.)
and a mouse. I wonder what was supposed to happen to the poor rat? <br />

Here, we have Sissel and Ray. Though, we obviously can't tell if the
desk lamp is in fact possessed and playing the part of wise old spirit
advisor. It could just be a desk lamp. This does seem reminiscent of a
certain scene from early on in the game. <br />

Here we have... uh, Lynne? Unlike a certain man in red, she looks
really different in the prototype. It looks
like she's being picked on by two hitmen (I doubt they are friendly,
considering her stance and the fact they are wielding shotguns) This
room doesn't look like anywhere in the game, but I'm inclined to think
it's in the junkyard. <br />
<br />
<img src="proto/proto4.jpg" height="180" width="313" /><br />
<br />
Now things are getting weird. Sissel and Lynne are running off
together. Someone's yelling at them, probably the hitmen, telling them
to stop. I would assume that he burst in to come to her aid and they
ran for it. Thing is, Sissel obviously winds up dead, right? They are
pretty close to where his body is lying in the other pictures actually.
Most likely the hitmen shot him dead then dumped him there.<br />
<br />
As we can see, things were going to be very different in the prototype.<br />
