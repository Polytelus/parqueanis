<p class="style1">Sissel: Just as before, rain passes through me as it
makes its way to the ground. I wonder if that red-headed woman is still
here...?</p>
<p class="style1">(Lynne walks over to stand in front of the body)</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: After that telephone call, she reported the
whole incident to the police. This junkyard is such an out-of-the-way
place. It'll take them a while to get here... Until they arrive,
though, it looks like she's watching over your body. </p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: A sense of duty, eh? It's a wonder she isn't
scared of ghosts in this spooky place.</p>
<p class="style1">(Ray dances)</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: The ghosts are already here! Heh heh.</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: Hey, cut that out! She'll think I'm haunting
the place!</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: In any case... ...just leave this place to me.
You go out and pursue your mystery.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="style1">7:42pm</p>
<p class="style1">[Junkyard]</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: So how was your meeting with your murderer?</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: There were a couple of guys, but I don't
remember ever seeing them before.</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: But don't forget, you've lost your memory. Who
knows? They might even be good friends of yours. </p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: (They're not exactly the types I'd ever want
to be best buddies with...) By the way, where is our redhead?</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: I think she's around here somewhere.</p>
<p class="style1">(Lynne's dialog bubble)</p>
<p class="style1">Lynne: So that guy in the black suit was targeting
me... But why...? And then that wrecking ball came down and saved me...
But how? ....... There's something funny going on tonight. And I've got
a bad feeling about it!</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: (I'll save her as many times as it takes...
as long as she helps out with my mystery. Besides, how many times can a
person die in one night, right?)</p>
<p class="style1">[Luxurious Parlor]</p>
<p class="style1">Servant: Preparations are almost complete, sir. </p>
<p class="style1">Sith: Hmm, yes... Finally! I'm starting to get sick
of grapes, my good man.</p>
<p class="style1">Servant: We have other fruit, sir. Might I suggest
you try one of them, sir?</p>
<p class="style1">Sith: Bah! I thought I would, after I finish this
bunch... but, I say, no matter how many I eat, there always seem to be
more...</p>
<p class="style1">Servant: I see, sir. In any case, soon, the telephone
will be out of service for a while, sir. So you will be receiving "One
Step Ahead" Tengo's report a little later, sir.</p>
<p class="style1">Sith: Very good, very good.</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: (The telephone is going to be "out of
service"?!)</p>

<p class="style1">Servant: Are you all right, sir?!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Minister: I ordered all of you not to come near me!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Servant: I-I beg your pardon, sir!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Minister: *sigh* I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled
at you like that. But I'd like to be left alone right now. You may go.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Servant: Yes, sir!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: Oh, boy. Another strange room, and another
strange person. (I wish these telephone lines came with nameplates or
something... Sheesh.)<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">[Lady's Red Apt.]<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: Still typing away passionately, I see. She'd
type her fingers to the bone to complete her tale of love, I imagine.
The little girl with the fever seems to be sleeping now. I hope she's
having sweet dreams.<br>

<p class="style1">[Park]<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: It appears to be the entrance of a
nearly-deserted, dimly-lit park. The voices of two young people drift
over to me on the breeze...<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: Stop the park from being turned into a
housing site! Protect the park, the rock of the gods!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: Oh, sorry, but could you do that somewhere
else? I'm a little busy right now. I don't have time to talk. <br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: I suppose you think I'm a man of dubious
character, a questionable person...!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: No, I, uh...<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: But if an objective person were asked,
they might think YOU were a little suspicious, yourself! As two
suspicious characters, shouldn't we take the time to converse with each
other?<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: Oh, boy... All right. But just for a minute.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: There! I like your attitude! I like it
very much! Let's relax and talk a while, then. The night is young, and
so are we!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: Oh, man...<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">[Troubled Man's Office]<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: He still appears to be deeply troubled. If he
doesn't have any work to do, why doesn't he just go home and go to bed?
Maybe the fact he doesn't have any work to do is what has him deeply
troubled...? I have quite a bit of work to do, myself. Don't know which
of us is in a more enviable situation, though...</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>8:20pm</strong></p>
<p class="style1">[Park]</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: The entrance to the park, still as
nearly-deserted as before. The voice of one of the young people has
become more animated...</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: This park! This park is in the midst of a
crisis! A calamity! The park is in trouble!</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: So... A housing site, huh? That's what they
want to make this place into?</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: Oh, what an evil plan! A terrible plot
that will surely bring down the wrath of the gods upon us!</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: Oh, I get it now... You LIVE in this park,
don't you?</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: Well, I can't deny that that, indeed,
might be the case, yes... However! This park is no ordinary park. No!
Not ordinary! The gods are here. The gods!</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: The gods, huh...? And what was that weird
thing you mentioned a minute ago? Something about the "house of the
gods" or something?</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: Yes! As I build my house on the rock of
the gods, it must be protected! We must protect it! If you look at
paragraph twenty-three of this leaflet, you'll see the "rock of the
gods" explained! Won't you take a moment with me now to study all about
it? The night is extremely young, and so are we!</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: ... You mind if I keep on working while you
talk?</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>8:22pm</strong></p>
<p class="style1">[Park]</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: The entrance to the nearly-deserted park... The voices 
of two young people drift over to me on the breeze...<br />
<br />
Protector: Listen and heed! Listen to my words! I&#39;m sure that unabashed peeping 
of yours may bring a momentary thrill... But remember! The gods are &quot;peeping&quot; at 
us at all times! And that is why I stand before you now to ask you this 
question! Do you peep at the gods?<br />
<br />
Rindge: ........<br />
<br />
Protector: The gods are everywhere. They are all around us. So, come on. I 
invite you now to come and converse with me! The night is... getting late! And 
we are young!<br />

Rindge: ........<br />

else?)<br>

<p class="style1">Blue Detective: I want to be a legendary detective
someday. <br>
</p>
<p class="style1">McCaw: Oh yeah? In that case, you oughtta start doing
whatever you can now to prepare. <br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Blue Detective: To be honest, I already have. I've
started practicing some awesome dance moves to do while I'm
investigating.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">McCaw: Say what?<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Blue Detective: Inspector Cabanela already nabbed the
title of "Legendary Stair-Stepping Detective"... So I'm gonna be the
"Legendary Investigating Detective"!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">McCaw: I'm starting to feel a little worried...
Worried for the future of this nation's police organization, that is...

<p class="style1">[Lady's Red Apt.]<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: It looks like the novelist is still taken up
with her prime minister. The "atmosphere" is so thick in this room,
it's enough to make your eyes smart. I think I'd better leave, before
this air suffocates me...<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">[Troubled Man's Office]<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Minister: Maybe I was wrong... Maybe Emma was
right... Maybe it was a mistake I was ever born at all... But wait a
minute. If I'd never been born, Amelie wouldn't be here right now!
*groan* It's gotten to the point where I don't know what my mistakes
were...! What defines a "mistake," anyway? If something isn't right,
does that make it a mistake?!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: I'm out of here.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">[Park]<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: The entrance to the nearly-deserted park...
The detective who was ordered by Cabanela to perform a stake out... is
nowhere to be seen. Maybe he's in the restroom? I wonder if that
strange young man followed him in there...?<br>

<p class="style1">[The Chicken Kitchen]<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: I don't see any customers hungering for
chicken tonight. (I hear singing coming from the kitchen.)<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Chef: La la la! Tonight, I'm in love! In love with
you and only you! My darling Miss Chicken! Let me shower you with gifts
of salt and pepper! La la la!<br>

better be going.)<br>

<p class="style1">Ray: Oh, back again?<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: Yeah, just checking to see if anything's new.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: Well, let me see... A moment ago, your corpse
was taken away by the police.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: It was? Oh. (I guess I'll never see my poor
corpse again...)<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: Nothing is permanent. We lose everything in the
end...<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: But there are some things we can get back.
Right, Ray?<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: I suppose you are right. <br>

</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: Hmph... I suddenly feel so all alone. Yeah,
he was a pain in the neck, but now that he's gone... I feel almost like
I've been abandoned by the gods... <br>

starting to rub off on me.)<br>

else? I'm a little busy right now. I don't have time to talk.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: Then let me ask you this! The rock of the
gods, or this "Kamila" you mention... ...which is more important?
Please answer clearly and without reserve!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: Kamila, of course! Kamiiila!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Protector: The gods!<br>

looks pretty suspicious... <br>

</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: The old pigeon guy is still not back, eh?
But, you know... (...there's something different now about the
atmosphere of this place...) ....... Anyway, whatever. I'd better
follow my own leads. (If I ever have to come back here again, I suppose
fate will lead me here...)<br>

</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: It looks like the chef is back. The rich
sound of singing and the delicious aroma of chicken fills the air.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Chef: La la la! The last chicken of the night! La la
la! Cooked by me, in that secret, special way, for me alone! The
Chicken Kitchen will open again tomorrow to share its chicken with the
world! La la la!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: I sure would like to try some of that
chicken...<br>

<p class="style1">Minister: Did I make the right decision...? I can't
believe I let a death-row inmate go free, if only for the night...
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be justice minister...? Just what kind of
minister I was meant to be?!<br>

<p class="style1"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Sissel: The men
who were fixing the chair are gone. (I bet it's because the execution
has been called off...) They should've cleaned up a little better
before they left. (But there's nothing I can do about it from here...)<br>
