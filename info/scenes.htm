through me as it
makes its <br />
way to the ground. </p>
<p class="style1">Sissel:<br />
I wonder if that red-headed <br />
woman is still
here...?</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: <br />
After that telephone call, she <br />
reported the
whole incident to <br />
the police. <br />
<br />
Ray:<br />
This junkyard is such an out-of-<br />
the-way
place. It'll take them a <br />
while to get here... </p>
<p class="style1">Ray:<br />
Until they arrive,
though, <br />
it looks like she's <br />
watching over your body. </p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: <br />
A sense of duty, eh? It's a <br />
wonder she isn't
scared of <br />
ghosts in this spooky place.</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: <br />
The ghosts are already <br />
here! Heh heh.</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: <br />
Hey, cut that out! She'll <br />
think I'm haunting
the <br />
place!</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: <br />
In any case... </p>

...just leave this place to me.

<p class="style1">Ray: <br />
So how was your meeting <br />
with your murderer?</p>
<p class="style1">Sissel: <br />
There were a couple of <br />
guys, but I don't
remember <br />
ever seeing them before.</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: <br />
But don't forget, you've <br />
<span class="auto-style1">lost your memory</span>. <br />
<br />
Ray:<br />
Who
knows? They might even <br />
be good friends of yours. </p>

<p class="style1">Sissel:<br />
By the way, where is our <br />
redhead?</p>
<p class="style1">Ray: <br />
I think she's around <br />
here somewhere.</p>
<p class="style1">Lynne: <br />
So that guy in the black <br />
suit was <span class="auto-style1">targeting
me</span>... </p>
<p class="style1">Lynne:<br />
But why...? <br />
<br />
Lynne:<br />
And then that wrecking ball <br />
came down and <span class="auto-style1">saved me</span>... </p>
<p class="style1">Lynne:<br />
But how? <br />
<br />
Lynne:<br />
....... </p>
<p class="style1">Lynne:&nbsp;<br />
There's something funny <br />
going on tonight. And I've <br />
got
a bad feeling about it!</p>

over to <br />
me on the breeze...<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
Stop the park from being turned <br />
into a

</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: <br />
Uh, sorry, but could you <br />
do that somewhere
else? 
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge:<br />
I'm a little busy right now. <br />
I don't have time to talk. <br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
I suppose you think I'm a <br />
man of dubious
character, <br />
a <span class="auto-style1">questionable person.</span>..!<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: <br />
No, I, uh...<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
But if an objective person were <br />
asked,
they might think YOU were <br />
a little suspicious, yourself! <br />
<br />
Youth:<br />
As two
<span class="auto-style1">suspicious characters</span>, <br />
shouldn't we take the time to <br />
converse with each
other?<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: <br />
Oh, boy... All right. But <br />
just for a minute.<br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
There! I like your attitude! <br />
I like it
very much! Let's <br />
relax and talk a while, then. <br />
<br />

He still appears to be <br />
deeply troubled. <br />
<br />
Sissel:<br />
If he
doesn't have any work<br />
to do, why doesn't he just <br />
go home and go to bed?
<br />
<br />
Sissel:<br />
Maybe the fact he doesn't <br />
have any work to do is what <br />
has him deeply
troubled...? <br />
<br />
Sissel:<br />
I have quite a bit of <br />
work to do, myself. <br />
<br />

Don't know which

nearly-<br />
deserted as before. <br />
<br />
Sissel:<br />
The voice of one of <br />

<br />
become more animated...</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
This park! This park is in the <br />
midst of a
crisis! A calamity! <br />
The park is in trouble!</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: <br />
So... A housing site, huh? <br />
That's what they
want to <br />
make this place into?</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
Oh, what an evil plan! A terrible <br />
plot
that will surely bring down <br />
the wrath of the gods upon us!</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: <br />
Oh, I get it now... You LIVE <br />
in this park,
don't you?</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
Well, I can't deny that <br />
that, indeed,
might be <br />
the case, yes... However! <br />
<br />
Youth:<br />
This park is no ordinary <br />
park. No!
Not ordinary! The <br />
gods are here. The gods!</p>
<p class="style1">Rindge: <br />
The gods, huh...? And what <br />
was that weird
thing you <br />
mentioned a minute ago? <br />
<br />
Rindge:<br />
Something about the <br />
"house of the
gods" or <br />
something?</p>
<p class="style1">Youth: <br />
Yes! As I build my house on <br />
the <span class="auto-style1">rock of
the gods</span>, it must be <br />
protected! We must protect it! <br />
<br />
Youth:<br />
If you look at
paragraph twenty-<br />
three of this leaflet, you'll see the <br />
"rock of the
gods" explained! <br />
<br />
Youth:<br />
Won't you take a moment with <br />
me now to study all about
it? </p>
<p class="style1">Youth:<br />
The night is extremely young, <br />
and so are we!</p>
